Revision history for CGI-Application-Plugin-FillInForm

1.13 09/01/05
    - fixed a test failure when using an older version of HTML::FillInForm
    - added dist/prove_prereqs.pl for testing with older versions of
      prerequisite modules.  See the source of that script file for info.

1.12 08/30/05
    - added Michael Graham to list of maintainers in docs to reduce
      confusion over which is the official version

1.12_01 08/23/05
    - To conserve memory, fill_form now returns a reference to the HTML
      output instead of a copy of it (Cees Hek).

1.11    08/15/05
    - added CGI::Application to the prerequisites
    - now mode_param (e.g. 'rm') is always ignored by default

1.10    07/31/05
    - clarified the docs about multiple data sources
    - upped the version number so this package cleanly supercedes all
      previous versions.

    - now can accept list of data sources (Michael Graham)
    - added tests (Michael Graham)
    - fixed bug where $data was being ignored

      version from 1.0_3 to 1.00_3

    - Ignore 'rm' instead of deleting it.
    - require HTML::FillInForm 1.05 for good measure.
