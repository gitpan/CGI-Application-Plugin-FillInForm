NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::FillInForm - integrate with HTML::FillInForm

SYNOPSIS
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::FillInForm (qw/fill_form/);

        my $t = $self->load_tmpl('farm.html');
        $t->param( organic => 'less_pesticides' );

        return $self->fill_form( \$t->output );

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provides a mix-in method to make using HTML::FillInForm more
    convenient.

  fill_form()
     # fill an HTML form with data in a hashref or from an object with with a param() method
     my $filled_html = $self->fill_form($html, $data);

     # ...or fill from a list of data sources
     # (each item in the list can be either a hashref or an object)
     my $filled_html = $self->fill_form($html, [$user, $group, $query]);

     # ...or default to getting data from $self->query()
     my $filled_html = $self->fill_form($html);

     # extra fields will be passed on through:
     my $filled_html = $self->fill_form($html, undef, fill_password => 0 );

    This method provides an easier syntax for calling HTML::FillInForm, and
    an intelligent default of using $self->query() as the default data
    source.

    By default, the mode param (usually 'rm') of every data source will be
    ignored. This prevents accidently clobbering your run mode for the next
    page, which may be stored in a hidden field.

    $html must be a scalarref, or a reference to a scalarref. $filled_html
    will be a reference to a string.

    Because this method only loads HTML::FillInForm if it's needed, it
    should be reasonable to load it in a base class and always have it
    available:

      use CGI::Application::Plugin::FillInForm (qw/fill_form/);
